🏨 Hotel Reservation Cancellation Prediction – MLOps Project
==============================================================
Google Cloud | Jenkins | Docker | MLflow | Flask | LightGBM

A production-grade MLOps pipeline designed to predict the likelihood of hotel reservation cancellations, helping businesses improve revenue strategies, reduce losses from overbooking, and flag potentially fraudulent activity.

🚀 Key Highlights
=====================
End-to-End MLOps Workflow: Built a modular, scalable system covering data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, experiment tracking, and CI/CD deployment.

CI/CD Automation: Configured Jenkins pipelines to automate the building and deployment of Docker containers to Google Cloud Run, enabling seamless updates.

Model Training & Tuning: Employed LightGBM with RandomizedSearchCV for efficient hyperparameter tuning. Addressed imbalanced data using SMOTE and improved model accuracy through label encoding and skew correction.

Experiment Tracking with MLflow: Implemented MLflow to track parameters, metrics, and models across multiple training runs.

Interactive Flask UI: Built a web-based user interface for submitting inputs and viewing predictions in real-time.

Cloud-Native Stack: Leveraged Google Cloud Storage for data storage, and Google Container Registry for container image management.

💼 Real-World Applications
===============================
Revenue Optimization: Predicts cancellation likelihood for better overbooking strategies.

User Retention: Identifies users likely to cancel, enabling timely, personalized offers.

Fraud Detection: Flags habitual cancellers based on behavior patterns.
